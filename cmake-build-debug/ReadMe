1.Case studies should be run like this(redirect your screen output to a file like below):

./simulator log1.txt 5 > output1.txt
./simulator log2.txt 15 > output2.txt
./simulator log3.txt 46 > output3.txt
./simulator log3.txt 17 > output4.txt

To test:
1.Copy the test*.cpp and the Makefile in your directory
(Must not be the same one where you have your codes and own Makefile, also copy your output*.txt files there)
2.Modify the Makefile by including the path of your cloned google test directory
3.make build
4.make run
